;;; Commentary:

;; Bufler is like a butler for your buffers, presenting them to you in
;; an organized way based on your instructions.  The instructions are
;; written as grouping rules in a simple language, allowing you to
;; customize the way buffers are grouped.  The default rules are
;; designed to be generally useful, so you don't have to write your
;; own.

;; It also provides a workspace mode which allows frames to focus on
;; buffers in certain groups.  Since the groups are created
;; automatically, the workspaces are created dynamically, rather than
;; requiring you to put buffers in workspaces manually.

  "List of grouping functions recursively applied to buffers.
Note that this is likely to look very ugly in the customization
UI due to lambdas being byte-compiled.  Please see the source
code for this option's definition to see the human-readable group
definitions.

Each item may be an Bufler grouping function or a list of
grouping functions (each element of which may also be a list, and
so forth, spiraling into infinity...oh, hello, Alice).

When a buffer matches the first grouping function in a list of
them, it is recursively grouped according to the rest of the
functions in that group; otherwise it is matched by the rest of
the functions after that group.  Therefore, a list may contain a
single grouping function to prevent further sub-grouping of
buffers matching a function.

This may seem confusing at first, but once you get the hang of
it, it's powerful and flexible.  Study the default groups and the
resulting output, and you should figure it out quickly enough."
