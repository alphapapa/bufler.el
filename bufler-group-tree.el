;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements recursive, lambda-based sequence-grouping
;; functions on top of `cl-lib', `map', and `seq'.

;; NOTE: When grouping lists (as opposed to other sequences, but we
;; only group lists), `-group-by' from dash.el would be somewhat
;; faster than `seq-group-by'.  However, let's not add more
;; dependencies than necessary (we already use dash.el in other files,
;; but let's aim to minimize dependencies).
