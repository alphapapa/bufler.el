*** DONE Prefix to =bufler-list= to clear cache

Sometimes changing =bufler-groups= doesn't seem to take effect because =buffer-list= hasn't changed and =bufler-buffers= is cached.

*** DONE Explain the big 4 features

:END:

I think the big 4 features now are basically:

1.  =bufler-list=
2.  =bufler-switch-buffer=
3.  =bufler-workspace-mode=
4.  =bufler-tabs-mode=

And while they all work together, they can also be used independently.  =bufler-list= and =bufler-switch-buffer= don't even require =bufler-workspace-mode= to be activated.

** 0.3

*** TODO Testing

Can probably use =with-simulated-input= to do some testing, which will help with refactoring.

*** TODO Multiple Bufler buffers

i.e. call Bufler like ~(bufler :groups GROUPS :buffer-name "*Matrix Bufler*")~, and those variables should be set buffer-locally, and refreshing should use those values instead of the global ones.  That would allow multiple, unique Bufler buffers.

*** TODO Rename some things

e.g. the grouping rules should probably be =rules= rather than =groups=, to distinguish the rules from the groups of buffers that they produce.

*** TODO Use =group-tree-defmacro=

Was working fine in the prototype, so it should work fine here too.  But I want to release 0.2 before making any changes like this.

*** TODO Keyword arguments to groups

e.g. instead of:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(group-not "*Special*" (group ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

Something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(group-not :name "*Special*" (group ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

Which should also allow:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(group-not (group ...) ...)
#+END_SRC

That would provide a lot of flexibility.

*** TODO Try to improve vc-state

Here's a common scenario:

1.  =bufler-list=.
2.  Switch to a buffer showing a file in a project.
3.  Make changes, save file, switch to =magit-status=, commit.
4.  =bufler-list=.  Even though the file is now up-to-date, it shows as =edited= because =vc-state= only gets updated when the buffer is saved, and the buffer hasn't been saved since it was committed.

Unfortunately, calling =vc-state-refresh= every time =bufler-list= is updated seems far too slow.

*** TODO Depend on =project= 0.3.0 and use =project-root= instead of =project-roots=

=project= is on ELPA, and the version there is newer than the one included with Emacs 26.3, and it declares =project-roots= obsolete.

*** TODO Use =cl-loop= instead of =-any?= and =-all?=

In these functions.  I'd expect =cl-loop= to be faster.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun bufler-and (name &rest preds)
    ;; Copied from dash-functional.el.
    "Return a grouping function that groups buffers matching all of PREDS.
  The resulting group is named NAME. This can also be used with a
  single predicate to apply a name to a group."
    (byte-compile (lambda (x)
                    (when (-all? (-cut funcall <> x) preds)
                      name))))

  (defun bufler-or (name &rest preds)
    ;; Copied from dash-functional.el.
    "Return a grouping function that groups buffers matching any of PREDS.
  The resulting group is named NAME."
    (byte-compile (lambda (x)
                    (when (-any? (-cut funcall <> x) preds)
                      name))))
#+END_SRC

*** DONE Pass ACTION argument to =pop-to-buffer=

As Mike Zamansky mentioned, it would be nice to be able to control how the =bufler-list= window opens.

** 0.4

*** TODO Buffer/group sorting

The WIP branch works pretty well already.

*** PROJECT ~bufler-defpred~

From [[https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el/pull/32#issuecomment-742928816][comment]]:

+ A macro like ~bufler-defpred~ would define a grouping predicate.  It would define a function like ~bufler--predicate-NAME~, and it would add its ~macrolet~ form to a variable like ~bufler-predicates~.
+ A function like ~bufler-define-expand-groups~ would define a function ~bufler-expand-groups~ which would splice in the predicate ~macrolet~ forms into the ~cl-macrolet~ form.
+ Users would do something like ~(setf bufler-groups (bufler-expand-groups ...))~.
+ New groups could be added with ~bufler-defpred~, which would also call ~bufler-define-expand-groups~ to redefine the expansion function to include the new predicate.

** 0.5

*** TODO Sortable columns


** 0.6

*** TODO Factor out GUI code

There should be a companion library to =group-tree= that provides the section-based view with columns.

* Ideas

** Integrate =bufler-workspace-mode= with =tab-bar-mode=

Rather than replacing the =tab-bar-tabs-function= and having Bufler groups be the only tabs displayed in the tab bar, selecting a Bufler group would add a tab to the bar, prefixed with =Bflr:=.  Selecting that tab would set the frame's =bufler-workspace-path= (probably by advising =tab-bar-switch-to-tab=).  There also needs to be an easy way to make a new tab for a Bufler group.

Selecting a tab bar tab would also cause the tab /line/ to only display buffers in that tab's Bufler group.

I think this would generally be more useful than the current implementation, but it means completely changing the design.

Also, I'm noticing that the tab bar redisplays from scratch every time Emacs does (i.e. on every keystroke, scroll event, etc.), so having =bufler-workspace-mode= active makes redisplay slow.  The code will need to be very optimized, and it might need another cache of some kind.

** Use =tree-widget= for displaying hierarchies

Jonas Bernoulli uses it in [[https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg/blob/master/epkg-desc.el][epkg-desc.el]], and it [[https://emacsmirror.net/assets/epkg.png][looks very nice]].  However, I'm guessing there are reasons he made or uses =magit-section= instead.

Of special interest is how it uses display properties to [[https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg/blob/edf8c009066360af61caedf67a2482eaa19481b0/epkg-desc.el#L363][align text in columns]].  That might be a good alternative to using =format= for alignment.

** Use ~tab-line-tabs-buffer-group-function~

e.g. see [[id:e5657361-b5a9-4ab7-af1d-8c365f8b6706][Amit's Thoughts: Emacs: prettier tab-line]].

** Non-consuming grouping option

The idea to have buffers appear in multiple groups which they match was mentioned in [[https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el/pull/24#issuecomment-738204637][this comment by Gerry Agbobada]].  Here's a rough concept of how the alternative to ~bufler-group-tree~ could work.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun group-tree-non-consuming (fns sequence)
    (cl-labels ((rec (fns sequence)
                     (cl-loop for fn in fns
                              collect (pcase fn
                                        ((pred functionp)
                                         (cons fn (cl-loop for item in sequence
                                                           when (funcall fn item)
                                                           collect item)))
                                        (`(,(and (pred stringp) label) ,(and (pred functionp) fn))
                                         (cons label (cl-loop for item in sequence
                                                              when (funcall fn item)
                                                              collect item)))
                                        ((pred listp)
                                         (cons (get-label (car fn))
                                               (rec (cdr fn) (cl-remove-if-not (get-fn (car fn)) sequence)))))))
                (get-fn (fn)
                        (pcase-exhaustive fn
                          (`(,(pred stringp) ,(pred functionp))
                           (cadr fn))
                          ((pred functionp)
                           fn)))
                (get-label (fn)
                           (pcase-exhaustive fn
                             (`(,(and (pred stringp) label) ,(pred functionp))
                              label)
                             ((pred functionp)
                              fn))))
      (rec fns sequence)))

  (cl-labels ((<5-p (n) (< n 5)))
    (group-tree-non-consuming (list (list (list "< 5" #'<5-p)
                                          (list "even" #'evenp)
                                          (list "non-zero" (-not #'zerop)))
                                    #'evenp)
                              '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)))
  ;; (("< 5"
  ;;   ("even" 0 2 4)
  ;;   ("non-zero" 1 2 3 4))
  ;;  (evenp 0 2 4 6 8))

** TODO Add Mike Zamansky's video to readme

** DONE Name

*** Bufler

Sort of like "buffer butler."  Maybe a buffalo for a mascot?

...Yep, works great!

*** Mr. Buffer

Sort of cute and catchy.  Maybe some clip art available.
